The Chain of Responsibility Pattern is very useful to avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along with the chain until an object handles it. We will implement a na√Øve security filter chain using this pattern in our practice exercise. You will certainly enjoy this exercise as it is a great way to get you totally master this pattern.

## Practice Materials
1. Use chain of responsibility pattern to create a naive security filter chain that will check the following responsibilities in order:
> 1. If any endpoint matches the request
>  - *False* - return *Not Found*
> 2. If the endpoint has any security rules
>  - *False* - return *Resource*
> 3. If the request contains any authorization header
>  - *False* - return *Unauthorized request*
> 4. If the authorization is approved
>  - *False* - return *Invalid authorization*
> 5. return *Resource*

### Components
- Handler (Interface for handling requests)
- ConcreteHandler (Handle the request it is the responsibility for or forwards it to its successor)
- Client (Initiate the request to a ConcreteHandler object on any part of the chain, in this example, it should start from the the first filter)

### Tips
- you may create a Helper class to handle some conditional logic
